= Summary =
== What is Yuma? ==
Yuma is a set of programs providing a complete network management system
and development environment, which implements the following standards:

* Network Configuration Protocol (RFC 4741)
* NETCONF over SSH (RFC 4742)
* NETCONF Notifications (RFC 5277)
* Partial Lock RPC for NETCONF (RFC 5717)
* YANG Data Modeling Language (RFC 6020)
* Common YANG Data Types (RFC 6021)
* NETCONF Monitoring Schema (RFC 6022)
* With-defaults capability for NETCONF (RFC TBD)
* SSH2 (RFC 4252 - 4254)
* XML 1.0
* XPath 1.0
* YANG Data modeling language (RFC 6020)

The following programs are included in the Yuma suite:
* '''yangcli''': NETCONF over SSH client, providing a simple but
powerful command line interface for management of any NETCONF content
defined in YANG
* '''netconfd''': NETCONF over SSH server, providing complete and
automated support for the YANG content accessible with the NETCONF
protocol
* '''netconf-subsystem''': thin client used to allow OpenSSH to
communicate with the netconfd program. This is documented as part of the
'''netconfd''' program, since they must be used together.

Optional programs in yuma123 not built and installed by default:
* '''yangdump''': validates YANG modules and uses them to generate other
formats, such as HTML, XSD, SQL, and C source code
* '''yangdiff''': reports semantic differences between two revisions of
a YANG module, and generates YANG revision statements

Although any arbitrary YANG file can be automatically supported by Yuma,
the following content (YANG modules) is built into the '''netconfd'''
server, and supported by the '''yangcli''' client:

* '''yuma-netconf.yang''': all the NETCONF protocol operations,
including all YANG extensions to the NETCONF protocol (RFC 4741). This
file contains meta-data used in the yangcli and netconfd programs, which
is not available in the '''ietf-netconf.yang''' version.
* '''ietf-yang-types.yang''': the standard derived types library in
progress for YANG. This module is being developed by the NETMOD WG. (RFC
6021)
* '''ietf-inet-types.yang''': the standard Internet address types
library in progress for YANG. This module is being developed by the
NETMOD WG. (RFC 6021)
* '''ietf-netconf-monitoring.yang: '''the standard NETCONF monitoring
module in progress by the NETCONF WG (RFC 6022)
* '''ietf-netconf-partial-lock.yang''': the standard NETCONF module for
multiple concurrent partial database locks (RFC 5717).
* '''ietf-with-defaults.yang''': the standard NETCONF default value
control module in progress by the NETCONF WG
(draft-ietf-netconf-with-defaults-10.txt)
* '''yuma-mysession.yang''': NETCONF session customization operations
* '''notifications.yang''': the standard NETCONF create-subscription
command to start receiving NETCONF notifications (RFC 5277)
* '''nc-notifications.yang''': the standard NETCONF notifications (RFC
5277)
* '''yuma-proc.yang''': /proc file system monitoring information
* '''ietf-system.yang''': IETF system group and common notifications
* '''ietf-netconf-acm.yang''': IETF Access Control Model
* '''test/pass/*.yang''': Several modules are included for testing YANG
and NETCONF behavior.
* '''test/fail/*.yang''': Several modules with errors are included for
testing YANG compiler behavior

== Intended Audience ==
This document is intended for users of the programs in the Yuma suite.

It contains the following information:

* Introduction to YANG and NETCONF based Network Management
* Yuma Configuration
* Yuma User Guides
* Yuma CLI Reference
* Yuma Error Reference

= Introduction =
The Yuma Tools suite provides automated support for development and
usage of network management information.

All management data is defined with the YANG data modeling language.

All management operations are encoded in XML 1.0 and performed with
standard NETCONF protocol operations.

== System Components ==
[[Image:software-components.png]]

The following external program is used by Yuma, and needs to be
pre-installed:

* '''opensshd'''
** The SSH2 server code does not link with Yuma. Instead, the
'''netconf-subsystem''' program is invoked, and local connections are
made to the '''netconfd''' server from this SSH2 subsystem.

The following external libraries are used by Yuma, and need to be
pre-installed. They are usually installed by default and do not need to
be installed by you:

* '''libc6'''
** unix system library
* '''ncurses'''
** Curses terminal support (needed on Fedora platforms only)
* '''libxml2'''
** xmlTextReader XML parser
** pattern support

The following external library is built within Yuma and does not need to
be pre-installed:

* '''libtecla'''
** command line support for '''yangcli'''

The following shared (or static) library is built by Yuma and used by
almost all of its programs:

* '''libyumancx'''
** YANG parser
** YANG validation
** basic NETCONF support
** XPath support
** configuration database support

The following libraries are built by Yuma, and used within executables:

* '''libyumaagt'''
** NETCONF server support
* '''libyumamgr'''
** NETCONF client support
* '''libyangrpc'''
** NETCONF minimalistic client support
* '''libydump'''
** yangdump translation functionality

The following binaries are built by Yuma:

* '''netconfd'''
** NETCONF server
* '''netconf-subsystem'''
** thin client between opensshd and NETCONF server
* '''yangcli'''
** NETCONF client
* '''yangdump'''
** YANG validation
* '''yangdiff'''
** YANG compare

The following sample netconfd module instrumentation library is provided
as an example. These libraries (e.g., libfoo.so) can only be created
with the Yuma SDK. Refer to the [[Yuma Developer Manual]] for details on
creating server instrumentation libraries.

* '''libtoaster'''
* Server instrumentation code for the YANG module libtoaster.yang.

=== YANG ===
A YANG module define the semantics and syntax of a specific management
feature. They are similar to SMIv2 (MIB) modules, but much more powerful
and extensible. YANG provides the ability to define a detailed
programmatic interface utilizing all protocol features:

* reusable derived data types
* reusable groupings of objects
* RPC operations
* database objects
* notifications

Network management software developers creating a new management feature
start by defining the YANG module(s) for the NETCONF representation of
the feature. This can include any mixture of new operations, data, and
notifications. Existing YANG modules can be augmented as well.

YANG provides complex nested data structures and choices, which allows
data modelers to design management interfaces which closely resemble the
native data structures within the server implementation.

It is easy to get started with YANG, and there are many optional
advanced features that can be utilized as well. YANG provides many
machine-readable constructs which allow Yuma to automate many aspects of
network management software development. 

[[Image:yang-modules.png]]

Semantics and details that are usually only found in 'description'
clauses can be understood and implemented automatically by the software
tools.

A YANG module can be a single file, or it can be split into an arbitrary
number of files, using sub-modules. A YANG submodule is essentially the
same as a main module, except that the namespace URI value is shared
between the main module and all its submodules.

A submodule is referenced with the include statement instead of the
import statement.

Submodules can also include other submodules, except a loop may not be
formed by the include statements.

Conceptually, the module is not nested. All definitions in submodules
appear at the top level of the YANG module, even submodules included by
other submodules.

All YANG modules and submodules have revision dates. The example shows a
simple version number, but the actual revision strings are date strings
in the form 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

Yuma programs support concurrent usage of different revisions of the
same module or submodule. This can occur via groupings from external
modules within the YANG language. Only one revision of a module can be
imported into a single module or submodule, but any of these files may
in turn import other modules. It is possible that a different version of
the same module could be indirectly imported in this case.

Deviation modules are normal YANG modules, except they only contain
deviation statements. These deviation statements are used to alter
(patch) the YANG modules with implementation-specific differences.

A deviation module can contain any number of deviation statements, and
they can apply to an arbitrary number of objects, from any module.
Multiple deviation statements for the same target will be combined by
the server before using them, and all deviate statements for the same
object will be validated together, as if they were all contained in the
same deviation statement. The order of the deviation statements is
irrelevant.

Deviations modules are processed first, and the deviation statements
save for later. The import statements are ignored, unlike real module
processing.

Since deviation modules are not identified in any way, Yuma programs use
the''' --module''' parameter to refer to a normal YANG module or
submodule, and the '''--deviation''' parameter to refer to a deviation
module.


[[Image:yang-features.png]]

The YANG feature statement is used to define a conceptual partition
within the module.

Objects that contain the if-feature statement for the corresponding
feature are part of the feature.

<nowiki>If the server does not advertise a feature in its
<capabilities>, then it is not supported, and all the objects that are
part of the feature are not supported.</nowiki>

Multiple if-feature statements form a logical AND expression. All the
referenced features must be enabled for the object to be available. In
the example above, leaf 'YY2' is not present unless feature A and B are
both advertised by the server.

=== NETCONF ===
The mandatory components of the NETCONF protocol are defined in RFC 6241
and RFC 6242.


[[Image:netconf-conceptual-layers.png]]

The NETCONF protocol is used to provide secure access all YANG content.
The server maintains a database which is accessed as if it was an XML
instance document.


[[Image:netconf-concepts-top-down.png]]

Data can be retrieved with XML (subtree) or XPath filters. Changes can
be validated before being activated. Databases can be locked to prevent
multiple managers from interfering with each other. Custom operations
can be used to perform complex actions and perhaps return some data as
well.


[[Image:netconf-concepts-bottom-up.png]]

NETCONF can utilize several secure transport protocols. The mandatory
transport (SSH2) is used by Yuma. The '''OpenSSH''' server is used in
the '''netconfd''' implementation, and '''libssh2''' library is used in
the '''yangcli''' implementation, to provide all SSH2 layer support.

By default, TCP port 830 (netconf-over-ssh) is used for all NETCONF
communications between '''yangcli''' and '''netconfd'''. TCP port 22
(ssh) is also supported by default, and additional TCP ports can be
configured.

NETCONF security is session-based. Privileges are granted to a session
based on the username provided in the SSH connection setup.

Access control is configurable (via '''ietf-netconf-acm.yang''' RFC
6536), based on group membership. The access control rules permit or
deny access to one or more groups, to a subset of the YANG content.
Separate defaults for read, write, and exec (RPC operation) access are
provided.

=== YANG-based Automation ===
Yuma is a 100% ‚native YANG‚ implementation. This means that YANG
modules are used directly by all the tools to control all aspects of
NETCONF protocol usage. There are no lossy translations, or complicated
configuration steps, in order to use a YANG module. Simply load a module
and start using it.

The automation concepts will be familiar to SNMP developers who use
SMIv2 to write MIB modules. The SMIv2 language contains enough
machine-readable clauses so a client and server can automate certain
aspects of the SNMP protocol implementation.

YANG does the same thing for NETCONF developers, only 10 times better.

[[Image:yang-as-source-code.png]]

There are many more machine-readable constructs in YANG, and more
powerful data modeling features. The complicated YANG features are
optional, so traditional 'DESCRIPTION clause' based semantics are still
supported.

The more machine-readable YANG clauses that are used, the more the
'''yangcli''' client and '''netconfd''' server can automate the entire
NETCONF protocol implementation.

[[Image:netconf-development-costs.png]]

The YANG language includes many ways to specify conditions for database
validity, which traditionally are only documented in DESCRIPTION
clauses:

<center>'''YANG Automation Constructs'''</center>



{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| <center>'''YANG statement'''</center>
| <center>'''description'''</center>

|-
|  '''config''' ''boolean''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| The '''config''' statement indicates if the object is writable, or
read-only. <nowiki>The server uses this information when automatically
skipping config=false entries for the <get-config> operation.</nowiki>

|-
| '''default''' ''string''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| The '''default''' statement specifies the mandatory-to-use default
value, if no leaf is provided. Unlike SMIv2 DEFVAL, it is not a
suggestion, and the client can rely on it. Defaults can be specified in
'''typedef''' or '''leaf''' statements. If both are defined, then the
leaf default will be used.

|-
| '''deviation '''''deviation-target-path'' { ‚¶ }
| The '''deviation''' statement allows any YANG object be customized for
a particular platform or implementation.. The tools can automatically
support the altered objects, based on the sub-statements within the
'''deviation''' statement. These changes can be of any nature, even
those normally not allowed in YANG. The intent of the deviation
statement os to accurately describe the object implementation, so the
tools can automate the protocol operations correctly, even for
non-standard implementations.

|-
| '''error-app-tag''' ''apptag-string''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| The''' error-app-tag''' statement can be used within the '''range''',
'''length''', and '''pattern''' statements. <nowiki>If a value is
invalid due to the corresponding error, then the <error-app-tag> field
in the <rpc-error> sent by the server will be set to the 'apptag-string'
</nowiki>value.

|-
| '''error-message''' ''errmsg-string''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| The''' error-message''' statement can be used within the '''range''',
'''length''', and '''pattern''' statements. <nowiki>If a value is
invalid due to the corresponding error, then the <error-message> field
in the <rpc-error> sent by the server will be set to the 'errmsg-string'
value.</nowiki>

|-
| style="border-top:none;border-bottom:0.5pt solid
#000000;border-left:0.5pt solid
#000000;border-right:none;padding:0.0382in;"| '''extension'''
| style="border-top:none;border-bottom:0.5pt solid
#000000;border-left:0.5pt solid #000000;border-right:0.5pt solid
#000000;padding:0.0382in;"| The '''extension''' statement allows a
vendor to add language extensions, and all YANG implementations must be
able to parse the extension correctly. However, only implementations
which actually understand the extension will support it. All others will
simply ignore the extension.

|-
| '''feature'''
| The '''feature''' statement allows a module to be conceptually
partitioned into mandatory and conditional object groups. All objects
with the corresponding if-feature statement will be present only if the
feature is supported by the server.

|-
| style="border-top:none;border-bottom:0.5pt solid
#000000;border-left:0.5pt solid
#000000;border-right:none;padding:0.0382in;"| '''if-feature'''
''feature-name;''
| style="border-top:none;border-bottom:0.5pt solid
#000000;border-left:0.5pt solid #000000;border-right:0.5pt solid
#000000;padding:0.0382in;"| Construct containing the''' if-feature'''
statement is only included if the specified feature is supported by the
server. Otherwise, the object does not exist on the server.

|-
| '''import''' (by revision)
| The import statement allows definitions from other modules to be used.
A specific revision date can be used within the entire module. However,
it is possible that different versions of imported typedefs and
groupings can be used, if one imported module also imports some modules.

|-
| '''include''' (by revision)
| The '''include''' statement provides the exact same features as the
'''import '''statement, except it applied to sub-modules included within
a module (or other sub-modules), instead of other modules. It allows
multiple sub-modules to be combined to create one conceptual YANG
module.

|-
| '''key''' ''key-leaf-list''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| The '''key''' statement indicates a set of one or more top-level leafs
within the list that are used to name a specific instance of the
particular list object. <nowiki>All protocol operations, such as
<edit-config>, can be fully automated, based on the information in this
statement.</nowiki>

|-
| '''length''' ''length-spec-string''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| The '''length''' statement is exactly like the '''range''' statement,
except it limits the length of string '''leaf''' and '''leaf-list'''
objects.

|-
| '''mandatory''' ''boolean''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| The '''mandatory''' statement indicates that the choice, list or leaf
must be provided by the client. It will not be created by the server.
Most parameters are not mandatory however, so the default is 'false' if
this statement is missing.

|-
| '''max-elements'''  ''number'' | 'unbounded' ;
| Specifies the maximum number of instances that a '''list''' or'''
leaf-list '''object can have in a valid database. The default is
'unbounded', if this statement is not present.

|-
| '''min-elements''' ''number''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| Specifies the minimum number of instances that a '''list''' or
'''leaf-list''' object must have in a valid database. The default is
zero, if this statement is not present.

|-
| '''must''' ''xpath-expr;''
| If the object containing the '''must''' statement exists, then the
XPath expression must evaluate to 'true' for the database to be valid.
This provides referential integrity checks among related parameters.

|-
| '''pattern''' ''pattern-string'' ;
| The '''pattern''' statement specifies a regular expression that must
evaluate to 'true' in order for the corresponding string '''leaf''' or
'''leaf-list''' object to be valid. Multiple patterns encountered in a
nested typedef chain must all evaluate to 'true' for the object to be
valid.

|-
| '''range''' ''range-spec-string'' ;
| The '''type''' statement can specify the range of a numeric type.
Since typedefs can be nested in YANG, the range statements are nested
also, and constitute an AND expression (i.e., all the range tests must
pass in the chain of type definitions.) THe keywords 'min' and 'max'
indicate the minimum and maximum values from the parent typedef (if
any), not the built-in type.

|-
| '''refine '''''refine-target-path'' { ‚¶ }
| The '''refine''' statement is defined within a '''uses''' statement,
and allows the specific grouping to be customized for each individual
copy of the grouping contents. The tools can automatically support the
refined objects, based on the sub-statements within the '''refine'''
statement.

|-
| '''revision''' ''revision-date'' { ‚¶ }
| The '''revision''' statement identifies the most current version of a
YANG module or sub-module. Multiple versions at once are supported in
YANG.

|-
| '''unique''' ''unique-node-lis''t;
| The unique statement indicates an arbitrary tuple of descendant nodes
within a list, which have to be unique within the list. These nodes are
not keys, and can be nested anywhere within a single list entry.

|-
| '''uses''' ''grouping-name''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| The '''uses''' statement inserts an instance of a reusable
'''grouping''', replacing the uses node within the conceptual data tree.

|-
| '''when''' ''xpath-expr;''
| The object containing the '''when''' statement is only allowed to
exist if the XPath expression evaluates to 'true'. This provides a
SPARSE AUGMENTS capability when combined with the augment statement.

|}

=== YANG Language Extensions ===
There are several YANG extensions that are supported by Yuma. They are
all defined in the YANG file named '''yuma-ncx.yang'''. They are used to
'tag' YANG definitions for some sort of automatic processing by Yuma
programs. Extensions are position-sensitive, and if not used in the
proper context, they will be ignored. A YANG extension statement must be
defined (somewhere) for every extension used in a YANG file, or an error
will be occur.

Most of these extensions apply to '''netconfd''' server behavior, but
not all of them. For example, the '''ncx:hidden''' extension will
prevent '''yangcli''' from displaying help for an object containing this
extension. Also, '''yangdump''' will skip this object in HTML output
mode.

The following table describes the supported YANG language extensions.
All other YANG extension statements will be ignored by Yuma, if
encountered in a YANG file:

<center>'''YANG Language Extensions'''</center>



{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| <center>'''extension'''</center>
| <center>'''description'''</center>

|-
|'''ncx:hidden'''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| Declares that the object definition should be hidden from all
automatic documentation generation. Help will not be available for the
object in '''yangcli'''.

|-
| '''ncx:metadata ''' ‚''attr-type  attr-name''‚;
|Defines a qualified XML attribute in the module namespace.

Allowed within an RPC input parameter.

'''attr-type''' is a valid type name with optional YANG prefix.

'''attr-name''' is the name of the XML attribute.

|-
| '''ncx:no-duplicates'''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
| Declares that the '''ncx:xsdlist''' data type is not allowed to
contain duplicate values. The default is to allow duplicate token
strings within an '''ncx:xsdlist''' value.

|-
|'''ncx:password'''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
|  Declares that a string data type is really a password, and will not
be displayed or matched by any filter.

|-
|'''ncx:qname;'''
|Declares that a string data type is really an XML qualified name. XML
prefixes will be properly generated by '''yangcli''' and '''netconfd'''.

|-
|'''ncx:root'''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
|<nowiki>Declares that the container parameter is really a NETCONF
database root, like <config> in the <edit-config> operations.
</nowiki>The child nodes of this container are not specified in the YANG
file. Instead, they are allowed to contain any top-level object from any
YANG file supported by the server.

|-
|'''ncx:schema-instance'''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
|Declares that a string data type is really an special schema instance
identifier string. It is the same as an instance-identifier built-in
type except the key leaf predicates are optional. For example, missing
key values indicate wild cards that will match all values in
'''nacm'''<nowiki> <data-rule> expressions.</nowiki>

|-
|'''nacm:secure;'''
|Declares that the database object is a secure object.

If the object is an '''rpc''' statement, then only the '''netconfd'''
'superuser' will be allowed to invoke this operation by default.

Otherwise, only read access will be allowed to this object by default,
Write access will only be allowed by the 'superuser', by default.

|-
|'''<nowiki>ncx:user-write <bits>;</nowiki>'''
|Declares the user write permissions that will be allowed for a
config=true data node. The bits parameter contains the write permissions
that will be allowed for the object (create, update, delete).

|-
|'''nacm:very-secure;'''
|Declares that the database object is a very secure object.

Only the 'superuser' will be allowed to access the object, by default.

|-
|'''ncx:xsdlist''' ‚''list-type''‚<nowiki>;</nowiki>
|Declares that a string data type is really an XSD style list.

'''list-type''' is a valid type name with optional YANG prefix.

<nowiki>List processing within <edit-config> will be automatically
handled by </nowiki>'''netconfd'''.

|-
|'''ncx:xpath'''<nowiki>;</nowiki>
|Declares that a string data type is really an XPath expression. XML
prefixes and all XPath processing will be done automatically by
'''yangcli''' and '''netconfd'''. 

|}

=== YANG Compiler ===
The Yuma programs all use the same centralized YANG language parser.

The complete YANG language is supported, as defined in RFC 6020. The
file naming conventions defined in this specification must be used,
along with all the language definition rules.

Definitions can be contained in modules and/or sub-modules.

Any number of revisions of a module or submodule can be used
concurrently, The '''import-by-revision''' and '''include-by-revision'''
features of YANG are fully supported, Refer to the section 'Searching
for Files' for more details.

All extension usage within YANG files is supported and saved. The
application data is available to all Yuma programs, including netconfd
server instrumentation. Refer to the [[Yuma Developer Manual]] for
details on writing YANG files and using the extensions built into Yuma.

Note: The '''smidump''' is not part of Yuma, but it can be utilized to
convert MIB modules written in SMIv2 into YANG modules, which can then
be implemented in '''netconfd''', and managed with '''yangcli'''. The
freely available '''libsmi''' library contains the '''smidump'''
program.

=== YANG Module Library ===
The central system component is the set of YANG data model modules which
define all available management information. This set of modules is
expected to grow over time, and there is usually a high degree of reuse
and inter-dependence between the modules.

YANG modules can import other modules to reuse any definitions, and to
augment objects in other modules. Each module represents one unique XML
namespace used within the NETCONF protocol. A module can be partitioned
into any number of submodules, each in a separate YANG file. The
submodules are conceptually combined, and only the entire module is
accessible to other modules.


'''Directory Layout'''


Yuma can utilize several directories to store files used during
operation. By default, a 'root' directory and all of its sub-directories
are searched for these files. Several different roots can be searched.
Generally, there is one centralized root (YUMA_INSTALL) shared by all
users, and one or more 'project' roots (YUMA_HOME), which can be shared
but may belong to a single user. 

The Yuma programs need to find and store the following types of files
during operations:

* YANG modules and submodules (*.yang):
* XML and text data files (usually *.txt or *.xml)
* command scripts for '''yangcli'''
* command-line-history file for''' yangcli'''

The search paths used to find these files are discussed in detail in the
System Configuration section.

'''Module Revisions'''

YANG has extensive module lifecycle support. Each module or submodule
has a revision date, and multiple revisions of the same module or
submodule may be used at once within the same server.

The YANG module repository is the authoritative source of common
management information for the '''netconfd''' server. However, different
platform implementations of the same data model need to be 'adjusted'
slightly to reflect differences in the feature support available on each
platform.

Yuma has an extensive set of mechanisms to automate the maintenance of
these platform-specific 'special requirements'. A single YANG module
(plus 'patches' and deviations as needed for each platform) can be
published, instead of a separate version of the YANG module for each
platform.

[[Image:cooked-modules.png]]

'''Module Naming Conventions'''


YANG module names are usually lower-case. Hyphen (-), underscore (_) and
period (.) characters are allowed, after the first character, which must
be a letter. It is suggested that only the at sign (@) character be used
as a separator between module name string components. YANG files must
use the suffix '.yang'. YIN files must use the suffix 'yin'.

There are two forms of YANG file names: with and without a revision
date.


'''module.yang'''

ietf-netconf-monitoring.yang (no revision or unspecified revision)


'''module@revision-date.yang'''

ietf-netconf-monitoring@2009-04-17.yang (must be the 2009-04-17 version)


These naming conventions are important when Yuma needs to resolve an
'import' or 'include' statement in a YANG file. Refer to section
[[#Searching for Files]]  for more details on YANG module search paths
and the 'import-by-revision' feature of YANG.

=== YANG Files ===
YANG modules and submodules are text files encoded in UTF-8. . There is
also an alternate XML encoding called YIN. Sometimes the term YANG
module is used to refer to the conceptual module, whether it is encoded
in YANG format or YIN format.

All Yuma Tools programs will accept either encoding format, however line
and column numbers are not correct in log messages for YIN encoded
modules. Instead, each XML node is given a monotonically increasing
value, and the XML document order is used instead of line numbers in
error/warning messages for YIN files. The column number is always '1'
for YIN files.

A module can be validated and checked for possible programming mistakes,
by using the '''yangdump''' program. Many 'reports' can also be
generated:

* exported symbols (--exports)
* imported modules (--dependencies)
* object identifiers (--identifiers)

The '''yangdump''' program is also used to generate other files, derived
from the YANG content:

* '''XML Schema Document (XSD)''': extends the NETCONF XSD with the YANG
content layer definitions (--format=xsd)
* '''HTML'''<nowiki> <div> or full file output: hyper-linked,
color-coded formatting of YANG modules to support netconf-central or
other WEB-based documentation system. </nowiki>There are several options
for configuring the output, and all formatting is done with Cascading
style-sheets (CSS) (--format=html)
* '''netconf-central''' documentation SQL database input file: supports
the automated online documentation of YANG content (--format=sqldb).
Refer to the netconfcentral.sql file for details on this output, in the
[[Yuma Developer Manual]].
* '''server instrumentation code-stubs''': the instrumentation callback
functions, used in '''netconfd''' for activating specific YANG content,
can be generated. This procedure is described in more detail in the
[[Yuma Developer Manual]].
* '''canonical YANG''': a YANG file can be reformatted so all statements
are indented uniformly, and always appear in the same order. Objects
marked as hidden (see the 'hidden' extension in yuma-ncx.yang) will not
be generated. (--format=yang)
* '''copy-YANG-and-set-name: '''A YANG module can be validated and then
copied (if no errors) to another location, adding the revision-date to
the file name. (--format=copy)

=== NETCONF Managers ===
The NETCONF client is an application that initiates and utilizes NETCONF
sessions to control and monitor a NETCONF server.

Yuma includes the '''yangcli''' application for this purpose. It can be
used as a stand-alone tool with any NETCONF server.

=== NETCONF Agents ===
The NETCONF server is a server application that is always running on the
managed device. It listens for NETCONF session requests from a NETCONF
client, and allows specific users to access specific subsets of the
available content (operations, database access, and notifications). It
processes all incoming protocol operation requests from the client, and
insulates all the instrumentation code from these protocol operations.

Yuma includes the '''netconfd''' application for this purpose. It can be
run on several different platforms, or easily adapted to embedded
platforms.

= System Configuration =
The Yuma programs use YANG to define its configuration parameters.

The 'ncx:cli' extension is used within a container with the same name as
the program to define all CLI parameters. Some parameters are shared
(see yuma-app-common.yang), so they are not located directly in the
container. 


 container yangcli {
     ncx:cli;
     // yangcli CLI parameters defined as choices and leafs here
 }

The following YANG modules are provided, which contain all the
configuration parameters for Yuma:

* '''yuma-types.yang''': contains common data types used in the Yuma
applications
* '''yuma-app-common.yang''': contains common CLI parameters used in all
Yuma applications
* '''yuma-ncx.yang:''' contains YANG extensions used in any YANG module,
including Yuma application modules
* '''yangdump.yang:''' configuration parameters for the '''yangdump'''
application
* '''yangdiff.yang''': configuration parameters for the '''yangdiff'''
application
* '''yangcli.yang''': configuration parameters and local commands for
the''' yangcli''' application
* '''netconfd.yang''': configuration parameters for the '''netconfd'''
server

Note:

* The '''netconf-subsystem''' program does not have any configuration
parameters at this time, so there is no YANG file defined for it.
* The '''openssh''' SSH server is configured separately, using the
'''sshd_config''' file. 
* The '''libtecla''' library, used by the yangcli program for command
line editing support, has its own configuration file '''~/.tecla''', to
override the default (emacs) editing key assignments. 

Yuma applications can accept configuration parameters from 3 sources,
checked in the following order:

# environment variables
# command line parameters
# configuration file

== Environment Variables ==
The Yuma programs utilize system environment variables to customize and
simplify configuration and operation of the programs.

These environment variables typically specify file search paths or
default directory locations.

The following environment variables are used within Yuma:

* HOME
* YUMA_HOME
* YUMA_INSTALL
* YUMA_MODPATH
* YUMA_DATAPATH
* YUMA_RUNPATH

=== $HOME ===
The '''$HOME''' environment variable contains the directory
specification of the user's home directory, and is expected to be set by
the system shell before use. The Yuma programs expect (by default) that
sub-directories and files contained in this directory will be readable
and writable.

Default value: none

CLI override: none

C shell example:
     setenv HOME  /home/andy

Bash shell example:
     export HOME=/home/andy

=== $YUMA_HOME ===
The '''$YUMA_HOME''' environment variable contains the directory
specification of the current Yuma project root directory. This is the
path to the 'netconf' directory, within a Yuma source tree.


Default value: none

CLI override: --yuma-home

CLI example:
     --yuma-home=/home/andy/swdev/yuma/trunk/netconf
 
C shell example:
     setenv YUMA_HOME  /home/andy/swdev/yuma/trunk/netconf

Bash shell example:
     export YUMA_HOME=/home/andy/swdev/yuma/trunk/netconf

=== $YUMA_INSTALL ===
The '''$YUMA_INSTALL''' environment variable contains the directory
specification of the Yuma installation root directory.

Default value: /usr/share/yuma

CLI override: none

C shell example:
     setenv YUMA_INSTALL  /sw/yuma

Bash shell example:
     export YUMA_INSTALL=/sw/yuma
 

=== $YUMA_MODPATH ===
The '''$YUMA_MODPATH''' environment variable contains a list of
directory specifications that should be searched (in order) to find YANG
or YIN modules and submodules. It can be used to extend the search path
beyond the default locations.

The syntax for this parameter is a string containing the desired
directory paths, separated by colon (:) characters. If the trailing
forward slash (/) character is missing, then it will be added when
searching for files.

By default, each entire directory and all its sub-directory contents
will be searched for the requested file. This can be overridden with the
'''--subdirs''' parameter. Refer to the Command Line Parameter Reference
for more details. If '''--subdirs=false''' is used, then only the
specified directory will be searched instead.

Note: This parameter specifies the exact directory locations when
searching for files. This is different than the '''$HOME''',
'''$YUMA_HOME''', and '''$YUMA_INSTALL''' environment variables, which
specify a Yuma root directory.


Default value: none

CLI override: --modpath

CLI example:
     --modpath=‚$HOME/modules2:/usr/local/modules‚
 
C shell example:
     setenv YUMA_MODPATH  ‚$HOME/modules2:/usr/local/modules‚
 
Bash shell example:
     export YUMA_MODPATH=‚$HOME/modules2:/usr/local/modules‚
 

=== $YUMA_DATAPATH ===
The '''$YUMA_DATAPATH''' environment variable contains a list of
directory specifications that should be searched (in order) to find data
files used by Yuma applications. It can be used to extend the search
path beyond the default locations.

Data files used by the '''yangcli''' program are affected by this
environment variable.

The location where the '''netconfd''' program''' '''keeps the file
'''startup-cfg.xml''' <nowiki>is also affected by this environment
variable. This file contains the contents of the non-volatile <startup>
database, which is loaded into the <running> database when the server
boots.</nowiki>

The syntax for this parameter is a string containing the desired
directory paths, separated by colon (:) characters. If the trailing
forward slash (/) character is missing, then it will be added when
searching for files.

By default, each entire directory and all its sub-directory contents
will be searched for the requested file. This can be overridden with
the''' --subdirs''' parameter. Refer to the Command Line Parameter
Reference for more details. If '''‚-subdirs=false''' is used, then only
the specified directory will be searched instead.

Note: This parameter specifies the exact directory locations when
searching for files. This is different than the '''$HOME''',
'''$YUMA_HOME''', and '''$YUMA_INSTALL''' environment variables, which
specify a Yuma root directory.


Default value: none

CLI override: --datapath

CLI example:
     --datapath=‚$HOME/mydata:$HOME/project1/data‚

C shell example:
     setenv YUMA_DATAPATH  ‚$HOME/mydata:$HOME/project1/data‚

Bash shell example:
     export YUMA_DATAPATH=‚$HOME/mydata:$HOME/project1/data‚
 

=== $YUMA_RUNPATH ===
The '''$YUMA_RUNPATH''' environment variable contains a list of
directory specifications that should be searched (in order) to find
script files used by Yuma applications. It can be used to extend the
search path beyond the default locations.

Script files used by the '''yangcli''' program are affected by this
environment variable.

The syntax for this parameter is a string containing the desired
directory paths, separated by colon (:) characters. If the trailing
forward slash (/) character is missing, then it will be added when
searching for files.

By default, each entire directory and all its sub-directory contents
will be searched for the requested file. This can be overridden with the
'''--subdirs''' parameter. Refer to the Command Line Parameter Reference
for more details. If '''--subdirs=false''' is used, then only the
specified directory will be searched instead.

Note: This parameter specifies the exact directory locations when
searching for files. This is different than the '''$HOME''',
'''$YUMA_HOME''', and '''$YUMA_INSTALL''' environment variables, which
specify a Yuma root directory.


Default value: none

CLI override: --runpath

CLI example:
     --runpath=‚$HOME/scripts:/usr/local/scripts‚

C shell example:
     setenv YUMA_RUNPATH  ‚$HOME/scripts:/usr/local/scripts‚
 
Bash shell example:
     export YUMA_RUNPATH=‚$HOME/scripts:/usr/local/scripts‚

== Searching for Files ==
All Yuma programs search for YANG and other files in the same manner,
using the same configuration parameters. The current working directory
is included in this search path, so it is important to consider the
directory in which a Yuma program is invoked. The search ends as soon as
a suitable matching file is found.

There are two types of module searches:

# searches on behalf of configuration parameters
# searches on behalf of YANG import or include statements

The first term in a path specification may contain special character
sequences:

* If the first character is the forward slash ('/'), then the entire
path specification is used as an absolute path specification.
         /usr/share/yang/modules

* If the first character is not the forward slash ('/'), and no special
characters are found instead, then the entire path specification is used
as an relative path specification, starting from the current working
directory.
  ../more-modules/test7.yang
  ./this-dir/my-module.yang
  testmodule.yang
  old-modules/version7/
 
* If the first character is the tilde ('~') character, followed by the
forward slash ('/') character, then the file search will start in the
current user's $HOME directory.
         ~/modules/test/test.yang

* If the first character is the tilde ('~') character, followed by a
user name, and then the forward slash ('/') character, then the file
search will start in the specified user's $HOME directory . If the user
is unknown, then the path specification is invalid.
         ~andy/modules/test/test.yang
         ~fred/scripts

* If the first character is the dollar sign ('$') character, followed by
an environment variable name, and then the forward slash ('/')
character, then the file search will start in the directory indicated by
the contents of the environment variable. If the variable is unknown, or
its contents do not represent a valid directory location, then the path
specification is invalid.
         $WORKDIR/tests/test-all-interfaces
         $YUMA_HOME/data/startup-cfg.xml

Note: Whenever Yuma searches a directory, it checks for the expected
file type, but ignores the following:

* all files and sub-directories that begin with the period (.) character
* any directory named 'CVS'
* symbolic links for regular files

The following environment variables affect file searches:

* $HOME
* $YUMA_HOME
* $YUMA_MODPATH
* $YUMA_DATAPATH
* $YUMA_RUNPATH

The following configuration parameters affect file searches:

* --yuma-home
* --modpath
* --datapath
* --runpath
* --subdirs

=== Yuma Work Directory ===
There is a directory ('''$HOME/.yuma''') created by '''yangcli''' or
'''netconfd''' for data files and temporary files. It is called
'''.yuma''', and it is created in the users home directory, if the
'''$HOME''' environment variable is defined.

This directory will be used as the default location to save the
'''startup-cfg.xml''' file by '''netconfd''', if no startup file is
specified in the CLI parameters, and no existing startup file is found
in the data file search path.

This directory is also used as the default location to store the
'''.yangcli_history ''' file for '''yangcli''' command line history
recall.

The '''$HOME/.yuma/tmp''' directory is used by '''yangcli''' to create
session-specific sub-directories where all the YANG modules from the
server for the current session are stored. If the '''--autoload=false'''
parameter is used, then these temporary directories will not be created
by '''yangcli'''.

=== Parameter Searches ===
A parameter search is started on behalf of a CLI parameter, such as the
'''‚-module''' parameter, used by the '''yangdump '''program. A search
of this type can include directory path and file extension in the search
parameter. If a filename with a file extension (must be '.yang') is
given, then only that exact file will be checked. The current working
directory will be used in this case, if no directory path (or a relative
directory path) is provided.
 --module=test.yang
 --module=../more-modules/test3@2009-04-01.yang

If the exact filename is not found, then the search failed.

If a parameter based search does not have any directory path or file
extension fields present, then a parameter search is the same as an
import/include search.

=== Import/Include Searches ===
An import or include search is started on behalf of a YANG 'import' or
'include' statement. A search of this type includes only the module or
submodule name, with no directory or file extension present. An optional
'revision-date' statement can be used in YANG, which means only a
version of the YANG file with that exact current revision date will be
used. 

There are separate search algorithms, depending on whether the
revision-date is used in the YANG import or include statement, and
whether the imported or included module has a current revision
statement.

'''Mode 1: import-by-revision'''

In this example, an import statement is causing a search for a module
named 'foo' with a revision date of '2009-01-15'.

If a revision-date is used in the import or include statement, then the
module search path will be checked as follows:

First, find a file with the same revision-date in the file name:

     import foo {
         revision-date ‚2009-01-15‚;
         prefix foo;
     }

If the file 'foo.2009-01-15.yang' is found, and the current revision
statement in the module is equal to '2009-01-15', then the search is
successfully terminated.

     // file foo.2009-01-15.yang
     module foo {
 
         namespace ‚[http://example.com/ns/foo
http://example.com/ns/foo]‚;
         prefix foo;
 
         // rest of header follows
 
         revision 2009-01-15 {
           description ‚Initial version.‚;
         }
 
         // rest of module follows
     }

If the file is not found, or the most current revision date is not
correct, then the module search is repeated for 'foo.yang'. If the file
'foo.yang' is found, and the current revision statement in the module is
equal to '2009-01-15', then the search is successfully terminated.

     // file foo.yang
     module foo {
 
         namespace ‚[http://example.com/ns/foo
http://example.com/ns/foo]‚;
         prefix foo;
 
         // rest of header follows
 
         revision 2009-01-15 {
           description ‚Initial version.‚;
         }
 
         // rest of module follows
     }

If the file is not found, or the most current revision date is not
correct, then the module search failed.


'''Mode 2: import any revision'''

If the import statement does not have revision-date sub-statement, then
the module search path is checked for a file with no revision-date in
the file name: 

     import foo {
         prefix foo;
     }

If the file 'foo.yang' is found, then it is used, regardless of the most
current revision date (if any) found in the module. If it is not found
then the module search failed.

Note: The first instance of 'foo.yang' in the module search path will be
used, even if a more current version is available, later in the search
path.

=== File Search Paths ===
Yuma uses configurable search paths to find the various files that are
needed during operation.

'''Module Search Path'''

* If the module parameter is specified with a path or file suffix, then
that filespec is tried, relative to the current working directory. If it
is not found, or not the correct revision date, then the search
terminates in failure. 

         --module=../test.yang

* If the module is specified without any path or file extension fields,
then the module search path is checked, in order. The first step which
produces a match terminates the search successfully. If all steps are
exhausted and no match is found then the search terminates in failure.

         --module=foo

# The current working directory is checked. No sub-directories are
checked, if any are present.
# Each directory specified in the '''$YUMA_MODPATH''' environment
variable, or set with the '''‚modpath''' configuration parameter, is
checked. 
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''$HOME/modules''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''$YUMA_HOME/modules''' directory is checked.
#*If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''$YUMA_INSTALL/modules''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=fasle''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.

'''Data Search Path'''

Yuma programs can store data used during operation.

An example of a data file is the startup configuration file used by
'''netconfd''', usually called '''startup-cfg.xml.'''

# If the file name has an absolute path specification, then that exact
file location is tried. If no match is found, then the search will
terminate in failure.
# Each directory specified in the '''$YUMA_DATAPATH''' environment
variable, or set with the '''‚datapath''' configuration parameter, is
checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The current working directory is checked. No sub-directories are
checked, if any are present
# The '''$HOME/data''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''$YUMA_HOME/data''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''$HOME/.yuma''' directory is checked.
# The '''$YUMA_INSTALL/data''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''/usr/share/yuma/data''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''/etc/yuma''' directory is checked.

'''Script Search Path'''

The '''yangcli''' program can store script files used during operation.

# If the file name has an absolute path specification, then that exact
file location is tried. If no match is found, then the search will
terminate in failure.
# The current working directory is checked. No sub-directories are
checked, if any are present.
# Each directory specified in the '''$YUMA_RUNPATH''' environment
variable, or set with the '''‚runpath''' configuration parameter, is
checked. 
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''$HOME/scripts''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''$YUMA_HOME/scripts''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.
# The '''$YUMA_INSTALL/scripts''' directory is checked.
#* If the '''‚-subdirs=false''' parameter is set, then only each
top-level directory will be checked. If it is not set, then
sub-directories will be searched.

== Configuration Files ==
The Yuma program configuration parameters can be stored in text or XML
files.

The '''-‚config '''parameter is used to specify that configuration
parameters should be retrieved from a file instead of the command line.

[[Image:default-linux-data-directories.png]]

Any other configuration parameter (except '''-‚config''') can be stored
in a configuration file used for program input.

=== XML Configuration Files ===
<nowiki>The XML format for these files follows the structure of the
NETCONF <config> element. </nowiki>Each parameter is stored within a
container identifying the application which it is being configured. The
'''netconfd'''<nowiki> stores its non-volatile <startup> database in
this format. </nowiki>XML configuration file contents can appear in any
order. 

The following configuration parameters affect the generation and display
of XML configuration files by '''netconfd''':

* --indent
* --with-defaults

The following configuration parameter affects the location of XML
configuration files by '''netconfd''':

* --datapath
* $YUMA_DATAPATH environment variable

Note : The IETF may standardize this container format soon. Do not rely
on the top-level namespace URI. <nowiki>Any top-level element name
<config>, in any namespace (even none), should be expected to contain a
complete NETCONF database, or a subset of a NETCONF database.</nowiki>

The following example show some database objects from the NETCONF Access
Control Model (yuma-nacm.yang), in XML configuration file format.

       </rule>
     </rule-list>
   </nacm>
 </config>

=== Text Configuration Files ===
The Yuma text configuration file format is based on some common Unix
.conf file formats:

* A hash mark until EOLN is treated as a comment

         <nowiki># this is a comment</nowiki>
         log-level info     <nowiki># this is also a comment</nowiki>

* All text is case-sensitive
* Whitespace before or within a line is not significant
* The 'end a line' (EOLN) character ('\n') is used to end a command, so
whitespace at the end of a line is significant.
* To enter a command on multiple lines, use an escaped EOLN
(backslash-EOLN) for all but the last line

         this is a command line
         this is the start \
         of a long \
         three line command
         this is a new command

* A YANG container parameter is represented by the container name,
followed by a left curly brace ('{'), zero or more child nodes, and then
a right curly brace ('}'). 
         yangdump {
             <nowiki># set some display control parameters</nowiki>

             indent 4
         }

* A YANG list parameter is represented by the list name, followed by a
whitespace separated sequence of key leaf values, followed by a left
curly brace ('{'), zero or more child nodes, and then a right curly
brace ('}').

* Configuration files which are used with command line parameters may
include program parameters for multiple applications.
** Only the top-level container that matches the name of the program
will be used.
** Any other top-level containers will be ignored
** Only the first instance of the desired program container will be
used. Any additional containers will be ignored.

     }

     yangdiff { 
         <nowiki># common yangdiff parameters here</nowiki>
     }

* Configuration file parameters can appear in any order. Only list index
strings need to appear in their defined order.
* The following configuration parameters affect generation and display
of text configuration files

* 
** --indent
** --with-defaults
** --display-mode

== Bootstrap CLI ==
Since Yuma programs use YANG to define CLI parameters, there needs to be
an initial bootstrap CLI phase, in order to process parameters which
affect the way YANG files are processed.

The bootstrap CLI is not as flexible as the main CLI processor, and the
syntax is more strict. Parameters must be entered in either of the
following forms:

* --name
* --name=value

If parameters are not entered in this format, then they will be skipped
until the main CLI parameter processing is done. This may cause
undesirable changes in key parameters, such as the module search path.

The following configuration parameters are also bootstrap parameters,
and will take effect immediately, if entered from the command line:

* '''--log''': log messages to the specified file instead of STDOUT
* '''--log-level''': set the logging verbosity level
* '''--log-append''': use the existing log file (if any) instead of
overwriting it
* '''--modpath''': use the specified module search path. This will
override the '''$YUMA_MODPATH''' environment variable, if it is set
* '''--yuma-home:''' use the specified project root. This will override
the '''$YUMA_HOME''' environment variable, if it is set

Refer to the Yuma CLI Reference for more details. on these configuration
parameters.

== Configuration Parameters ==
Command line parameters are used to provide input to Yuma programs when
they are invoked. They are also used extensively by the '''yangcli'''
program, to represent RPC method input parameters and database nodes
which are part of NETCONF operation content, such as the
'''<nowiki><config></nowiki>''' parameter within the
'''<nowiki><edit-config></nowiki>''' operation.


=== Parameter Syntax ===
A CLI parameter has 2 forms:

* Parameter contains a YANG type of 'empty' or a zero-length
'string':<br/> <nowiki><prefix><parameter-name></nowiki>
* Everything else:<br/>
<nowiki><prefix><parameter-name><separator><value></nowiki>

There are up to 4 components in a CLI parameter:

# '''prefix''': consists of 0, 1, or 2 consecutive dash characters.
# '''parameter name''': name of the parameter. A partial name may be
used if it is unique.
# '''separator''': either consists of the 'equals sign' character ('='),
which may be preceded or followed by whitespace, or just whitespace with
no equals sign character.
# '''value''': a quoted or unquoted string, an empty string is only
allowed if quotes are entered.

The following example shows some ways the leaf 'foo' could be entered as
a CLI parameter:

     leaf foo {
       type uint32;
     }

       foo=7 
      -foo=7 
     --foo=7
     --foo =7 
       foo 7 
      -foo 7 
      -foo = 7
     --foo 7 
     --foo "7" 
     foo 7

=== ncx:cli Extension ===
The '''ncx:cli''' extension is used in in YANG container definitions,
which represent the program CLI parameters, not NETCONF database
parameters. It does not take any parameters, and is defined in
'''yuma-ncx.yang'''.


     container yangcli {
         ncx:cli;
 
         // all the yangcli CLI parameters
     }

If this extension is present, then '''netconfd''' will ignore the
container when loading the database object definitions. Only the program
with the same name as the container will use the CLI parameter
definition.

=== ncx:default-parm Extension ===
The '''ncx:default-parm''' extension is used within a container with an
'''ncx:cli''' extension, or within an 'input' section of an RPC
operation definition. It is defined in '''yuma-ncx.yang'''.

If no parameter name is found when processing CLI parameter input, and
the '''ncx:default-parm''' extension is present in the container or RPC
input being processed, then the specified parameter name will be used
instead of generating an error. The value must be valid for the
parameter syntax, according to its YANG definition. <nowiki>This means
that for the default parameter, only the <value> component of the
complete parameter syntax may be used, as well as the normal
forms.</nowiki>


     container yangdump {
         ncx:cli;
         ncx:default-parm module;
 
         // all the yangdump CLI parameters
     }

When invoking the '''yangdump''' program, the default CLI parameter is
'''--module'''. These two command lines are equivalent:

     yangdump ‚-module=test1 ‚-module=test2
     yangdump test1 test2

A string that does not start with any dashes will still be tried as a
parameter name, before trying the default parameter. If the value used
for a default parameter conflicts with another parameter name, then the
normal form must be used, instead of this form.

     yangdump log-app  test1

Even if there was a module named 'log-app', it would not be tried as a
'''--module''' parameter, since it also matches the '''--log-append'''
parameter.

Note: the default parameter form is can be used in conjunction with
shell wildcard characters, depending on the shell.

     yangdump *.yang

     yangdump --subtree=.

These commands are equivalent in the '''yangdump''' program.

= XPath Reference =
The XPath 1.0 path specification language is supported in all Yuma Tools
programs, as specified in the YANG language specification. There are
also some additional variables and XPath functions, available in all
XPath expressions.

A custom XPath implementation is used, which is based on the internal
data structures maintained within the program (i.e., object tree or data
tree). No CPU or memory is wasted converting these data structures to
actual XML documents for XPath processing.

== XPath 1.0 ==
All functionality defined in the XPath 1.0 specification is supported.

There are some restrictions, which are specific to the YANG standard:

* The 'attribute' and 'processing-instruction' axes are always empty.
* YANG identityref leaf values need to be entered within quotes or they
will be interpreted as XML qualified node names.
* The server may not maintain consistent XML document order for
system-ordered data. This affects expressions which rely on XML document
order to be precise and completely static. A NETCONF server is only
required to maintain XML document order for user-ordered lists and
leaf-lists, and only relative to a particular object, not the entire
document.

=== XML Namespaces ===
The XPath implementation allows a more liberal syntax than the XPath 1.0
specification allows.

Specifically, if a node identifier is unqualified (i.e., there is no
namespace specified with a default namespace or an explicit namespace
declaration), then all known XML namespaces known by the program will be
checked for a top-level element with the same name.


* '''If XML namespaces are used, they must be used correctly.'''

'''Example request using XML namespaces in an XPath expression:'''

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <rpc message-id="3"
   xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
   xmlns:toast="http://netconfcentral.org/ns/toaster">
   <get>
     <filter type="xpath" select="/toast:toaster"/>
   </get>
 </rpc>

Note the text:


 '''xmlns:toast="[http://netconfcentral.org/ns/toaster
http://netconfcentral.org/ns/toaster]"'''

<nowiki>This 'xmlns' attribute does not have to appear exactly as
specified, or within the <rpc> element. </nowiki>It can appear in any
legal manner. Refer to the '''XML Namespaces 1.0 '''specification for
more details.


'''Example request not using XML namespaces in an XPath expression:'''


 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <rpc message-id="3"
   xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
   <get>
     <filter type="xpath" select="/toaster"/>
   </get>
 </rpc>

If the 'toaster.yang' module is loaded within the program, and if the
'toaster' node is enabled (e.g., not removed via a YANG deviation), then
the XML prefix ('toast:' in this example) can be omitted.

== YANG Specific XPath Behavior ==
The YANG language requires some minor changes and additions to the XPath
1.0 specification:

* The 'current' function from XPath 2.0 is supported.
* The NULL XML namespace is mapped to the current YANG module XML
namespace, when processing an XPath expression within a YANG module
(e.g., must statement).
* A NETCONF database is treated as a conceptual XML instance document
with zero or more top-level elements. This is consistent with XSLT
behavior. <nowiki>XML 1.0 requires a single top-level element,so
external XML documents representing a NETCONF database always start with
the <nc:config> element (config element in the NETCONF XML
namespace).</nowiki>

== Custom XPath Variables ==
The XPath specification supports system variables to be accessed within
XPath expressions.

Within the '''yangcli''' program, all user and system variables
available to a script are also available as XPath variables within XPath
expression evaluation (e.g., if, eval, and while commands).

For example, a variable named 'myvar' would be accessed within an XPath
expression as '$myvar'.

=== user ===
An XPath variable called 'user' is supported in the '''yangcli''' and
'''netconfd''' programs. It is equal to the NETCONF user name associated
with the session evaluating the XPath expression. It is provided to be
used in data rules within the NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM).


== Custom XPath Functions ==
The following XPath functions are added to the XPath 1.0 Function
Library, in addition to the 'current' function from XPath 2.0.

=== module-loaded ===
The '''module-loaded''' function tests whether the specified module is
loaded within the program.

'''<nowiki>boolean module-loaded (module-name [,
revision-date])</nowiki>'''

Parameters:

* Parameter 1:
** Type: String
** Usage: Mandatory
** Purpose: Specifies the module name to check.
* Parameter 2:
** Type: String
** Usage: Optional
** Purpose: Specifies the YANG revision date string for module indicated
by parameter 1.

Returns: Boolean

* true: the specified module is loaded
* false: the specified module is not loaded, possibly not known

Errors:

* Missing parameter error if no parameters provided.
* Extra parameters error if more than 2 parameters provided.
* All unknown parameter values cause a 'false' result.

Example:


 yangcli> if "module-loaded('toaster', '2009-11-20')"
 yangcli>    log-info 'correct toaster module loaded'
 yangcli> else
 yangcli>    log-error 'Wrong toaster module loaded'
 yangcli> end

=== feature-enabled ===
The''' feature-enabled''' function tests whether the specified YANG
feature is enabled within the program.

'''boolean feature-enabled (module-name, feature-name)'''

Parameters:

* Parameter 1:
** Type: String
** Usage: Mandatory
** Purpose: Specifies the module name to check.
* Parameter 2:
** Type: String
** Usage: Mandatory
** Purpose: Specifies the YANG feature name defined within the module
indicated by parameter 1.

Returns: Boolean

* true: the specified feature is enabled
* false: the specified feature is not enabled, possibly not known

Errors:

* Missing parameter error if less than 2 parameters provided.
* Extra parameters error if more than 2 parameters provided.
* All unknown parameter values cause a 'false' result.

Example:


 yangcli> if "feature-enabled('ietf-system', 'authentication')"
 yangcli>    log-info 'authentication feature is enabled'
 yangcli> else
 yangcli>    log-error 'authentication feature is not enabled'
 yangcli> end

= Error Reference =
All Yuma programs use the same set of error numbers and error messages.

Error numbers are 3 digit unsigned integers in the range 1 to 999. The
number 0 is reserved for the <nowiki>NO_ERR constant, which is the same
as the <ok/> status returned by the server.</nowiki>

<center>'''Error Number Types'''</center>

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| <center>'''range'''</center>
| <center>'''description'''</center>
|-
| 100 to 199
| system errors
|-
| 200 to 399
| user errors
|-
| 400 to 899
| warnings
|-
| 900 to 999
| informational messages
|}

== Error Messages ==
The current list of error numbers and default error messages can be
obtained with the '''yangdump''' program '''--show-errors''' parameter.

The default error message can be replaced for some error conditions with
the YANG error-message statement.

The following list shows the default error messages for all error
numbers currently in use.
