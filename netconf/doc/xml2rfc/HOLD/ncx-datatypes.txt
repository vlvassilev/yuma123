    <abstract>
      <t>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use 
         with the NETCONF Protocol requires a structured data modeling environment
         which promotes human usability, multi-vendor interoperability, and reuse
         of existing IETF data models written in SMIv2.  This document defines
         a Structure of Management Information suitable for use with the NETCONF protocol.

     <t>
      The Network Configuration Protocol <xref
      target="RFC4741">RFC&nbsp;4741</xref>.</t> defines an XML-based protocol for
      managing network device configuration databases.  However, there is no
      specifications for the inter-operable organization of a 
      conceptual NETCONF configuration database, and precisely how the standard NETCONF
      protocol operations behave on the configuration database.

           <t hangtext="application:">
             A set of functionally-related, owner-specific, conceptual
             data modeling interfaces.  All NCX data model objects exist
             within the scope and context of a single application.

           <t hangtext="data model object:">
            A definition within a data model module that
            represents conceptual management data, which can be accessed
            by a manager via a network
            management protocol. Also called an object.

           <t hangtext="data model notification:">
            A definition within a data model module that
            represents a conceptual notification message construct.

            which can be assigned (by name) to a data model object.

             A data type which defines simple conceptual content.
             Unlike XSD, a NCX simple type may define metadata
             (XML attributes). All simple types
             can be encoded in XML as simple XML content.

            A data type which defines complex conceptual content.
            Any data type which may define child nodes

            All NCX complex types are also XSD complex types.

            One of the NCX data types
            defined in the NCX language.  This is not the same as an 
            XSD 'base' type. All derived types have a base type, which 
            must be the same in order to compare two values of an arbitrary type.

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
